The conflict involving the Kurds primarily includes the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), the Turkish government, and various Kurdish groups in the Middle East, such as the People’s Democratic Party (HDP), the People’s Protection Unit (YPG), and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). The conflict began in 1984 when the PKK initiated an insurgency against Turkish authorities to seek greater cultural and political rights and establish an independent Kurdish state. It is taking place in Turkey, Syria, and Iraq, where the Kurds are located. The main causes of the conflict are the Kurdish quest for autonomy and the Turkish government's resistance to Kurdish separatism. The conflict persists due to historical grievances, ethnic tensions, and geopolitical interests. Major incidents include the collapse of a cease-fire in 2015, a coup attempt in 2016, and various military offensives and clashes between the involved parties. The conflict has resulted in significant casualties, property destruction, and population displacement. Citizens indirectly involved in the conflict have been affected by violence, human rights abuses, and political instability. Efforts to calm/stop the conflict have included cease-fires, military operations, and diplomatic initiatives. Foreign countries and organizations, such as the United States and the United Nations, have been involved in various capacities, but the results have been limited, and the conflict remains unresolved. The situation currently stands with ongoing military operations, human rights concerns, and political tensions between the parties involved.
