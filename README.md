The conflict involving the Kurds primarily includes the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), the Turkish government, and various Kurdish groups in the Middle East, such as the People’s Democratic Party (HDP), the People’s Protection Unit (YPG), and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). The conflict began in 1984 when the PKK initiated an insurgency against Turkish authorities to seek greater cultural and political rights and establish an independent Kurdish state. It is taking place in Turkey, Syria, and Iraq, where the Kurds are located. The main causes of the conflict are the Kurdish quest for autonomy and the Turkish government's resistance to Kurdish separatism. The conflict persists due to historical grievances, ethnic tensions, and geopolitical interests. Major incidents include the collapse of a cease-fire in 2015, a coup attempt in 2016, and various military offensives and clashes between the involved parties. The conflict has resulted in significant casualties, property destruction, and population displacement. Citizens indirectly involved in the conflict have been affected by violence, human rights abuses, and political instability. Efforts to calm/stop the conflict have included cease-fires, military operations, and diplomatic initiatives. Foreign countries and organizations, such as the United States and the United Nations, have been involved in various capacities, but the results have been limited, and the conflict remains unresolved. The situation currently stands with ongoing military operations, human rights concerns, and political tensions between the parties involved.

The conflict involving the Kurds in the Middle East has its roots in the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which was established in 1978 and has been waging an insurgency against Turkish authorities since 1984. The PKK's objective is to secure greater cultural and political rights, with the primary goal of establishing an independent Kurdish state. The conflict has led to significant casualties, with nearly forty thousand deaths reported. Tensions have also risen between Turkish authorities and Kurdish groups, leading to a series of violent confrontations and military operations. The impact of the conflict has been far-reaching, affecting not only Turkey but also other countries in the region, such as Syria and Iraq.
The conflict has resulted in a complex web of interactions and confrontations, involving various Kurdish groups and different state actors. For example, in Syria, Kurdish fighters have been combating the Islamic State as part of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and have carved out a semi-autonomous region in northern Syria. This has led to clashes with Turkish-backed rebels and the Turkish military, which has launched offensives against Kurdish-held areas in Syria. In Iraq, the Turkish military has targeted PKK bases and launched assaults in the northern Kurdish region.
The conflict has also had international implications, particularly for the United States, which has supported Kurdish groups in their fight against the Islamic State. However, this support has strained relations between the United States and Turkey, which considers some of these Kurdish groups as terrorist organizations. The conflict has also raised concerns about the potential for increased terrorist activity and the impact on secessionist movements in the region.
Recent developments include Turkey's continued military operations in northern Iraq and its efforts to maintain control over the zones it occupies in Syria. The conflict has also led to a crackdown on the Kurdish diaspora, with Turkey seeking cooperation from other countries to address suspected PKK members living abroad.
